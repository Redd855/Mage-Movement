## Mage Movement
Mage Movement is a 3D platformer inspired by the likes of Super Mario 64 and Pseudoregalia for Nintendo consoles and PC.

Run, Dive and jump precisely as a wizard to progress through the levels and reach the end

*This is just a tech demo to show off the movement of the wizard and only one level


## Features

You can cancel the dive and sliding at any time using the jump

(Try timing your jump to right after you land after a dive to improve your movement)
